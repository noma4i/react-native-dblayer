 * persisted key under the library namespace, clears all registered in-memory state and notifies
 * every live subscriber. There is no partial/per-model variant - the host app decides when to pull
 * it (e.g. on logout). Fully synchronous by design: state is clean the moment the call returns, with
 * no deferred teardown to await - seeding and subsequent reads can rely on it immediately. An async
 * resetter is a registration error and throws. No-ops when `configureDb` has never run - an
 * unconfigured runtime is trivially clean. Every resetter runs even when another throws; failures
 * are rethrown together as an `AggregateError` after storage and in-memory state are fully reset.
